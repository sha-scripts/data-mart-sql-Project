9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?
Let's try this mathematically. Consider average of (4,4,4,4,4,4) = (4*6)/6 = 4 and average(5) = 5 Average of averages = (4+5)/2 = 4.5 Average of all numbers = (24+5)/ = 4.1428

Hence, we can not use avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year and sales platform, because the result will be incorrect if we calculate average of an average to calculate the average.

SELECT calendar_year,
       platform,
       ROUND(SUM(sales)/SUM(transactions), 2) AS correct_avg,
       ROUND(AVG(avg_transaction), 2) AS incorrect_avg
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY 1,
         2
ORDER BY 1,
         2;
C. Before & After Analysis

This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect. We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before.

Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?

Before we proceed, we determine the the week_number corresponding to '2020-06-15' to use it as a filter in our analysis.

SELECT DISTINCT week_number
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE week_date = '2020-06-15' 
  AND calendar_year = '2020';
week_number
25
The week_number is 25. I created 2 CTEs:

packaging_sales CTE: Filter the dataset for 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15 and calculate the sum of sales within the period.
before_after_changes CTE: Utilize a CASE statement to capture the sales for 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15 and then calculate the total sales for the specified period.
WITH packaging_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    week_date, 
    week_number, 
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM clean_weekly_sales
  WHERE (week_number BETWEEN 21 AND 28) 
    AND (calendar_year = 2020)
  GROUP BY week_date, week_number
)
, before_after_changes AS (
  SELECT 
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN week_number BETWEEN 21 AND 24 THEN total_sales END) AS before_packaging_sales,
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 28 THEN total_sales END) AS after_packaging_sales
  FROM packaging_sales
)

SELECT 
  after_packaging_sales - before_packaging_sales AS sales_variance, 
  ROUND(100 * 
    (after_packaging_sales - before_packaging_sales) 
    / before_packaging_sales,2) AS variance_percentage
FROM before_after_changes;
Answer:

sales_variance	variance_percentage
-26884188	-1.15
Since the implementation of the new sustainable packaging, there has been a decrease in sales amounting by $26,884,188 reflecting a negative change at 1.15%. Introducing a new packaging does not always guarantee positive results as customers may not readily recognise your product on the shelves due to the change in packaging.

2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?

We can apply a similar approach and solution to address this question.

WITH packaging_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    week_date, 
    week_number, 
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM clean_weekly_sales
  WHERE (week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 37) 
    AND (calendar_year = 2020)
  GROUP BY week_date, week_number
)
, before_after_changes AS (
  SELECT 
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 24 THEN total_sales END) AS before_packaging_sales,
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 37 THEN total_sales END) AS after_packaging_sales
  FROM packaging_sales
)

SELECT 
  after_packaging_sales - before_packaging_sales AS sales_variance, 
  ROUND(100 * 
    (after_packaging_sales - before_packaging_sales) / before_packaging_sales,2) AS variance_percentage
FROM before_after_changes;
Answer:

sales_variance	variance_percentage
-152325394	-2.14
Looks like the sales have experienced a further decline, now at a negative 2.14%! If I'm Danny's boss, I wouldn't be too happy with the results.

3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?

I'm breaking down this question to 2 parts.

Part 1: How do the sale metrics for 4 weeks before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?

Basically, the question is asking us to find the sales variance between 4 weeks before and after '2020-06-15' for years 2018, 2019 and 2020. Perhaps we can find a pattern here.
We can apply the same solution as above and add calendar_year into the syntax.
WITH changes AS (
  SELECT 
    calendar_year,
    week_number, 
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM clean_weekly_sales
  WHERE week_number BETWEEN 21 AND 28
  GROUP BY calendar_year, week_number
)
, before_after_changes AS (
  SELECT 
    calendar_year,
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 24 THEN total_sales END) AS before_packaging_sales,
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 28 THEN total_sales END) AS after_packaging_sales
  FROM changes
  GROUP BY calendar_year
)

SELECT 
  calendar_year, 
  after_packaging_sales - before_packaging_sales AS sales_variance, 
  ROUND(100 * 
    (after_packaging_sales - before_packaging_sales) 
    / before_packaging_sales,2) AS variance_percentage
FROM before_after_changes;
Answer:

calendar_year	sales_variance	variance_percentage
2018	4102105	0.19
2019	2336594	0.10
2020	-26884188	-1.15
In 2018, there was a sales variance of $4,102,105, indicating a positive change of 0.19% compared to the period before the packaging change.

Similarly, in 2019, there was a sales variance of $2,336,594, corresponding to a positive change of 0.10% when comparing the period before and after the packaging change.

However, in 2020, there was a substantial decrease in sales following the packaging change. The sales variance amounted to $26,884,188, indicating a significant negative change of -1.15%. This reduction represents a considerable drop compared to the previous years.

Part 2: How do the sale metrics for 12 weeks before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?

Use the same solution above and change to week 13 to 24 for before and week 25 to 37 for after.
WITH changes AS (
  SELECT 
    calendar_year, 
    week_number, 
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM clean_weekly_sales
  WHERE week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 37
  GROUP BY calendar_year, week_number
)
, before_after_changes AS (
  SELECT 
    calendar_year,
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 24 THEN total_sales END) AS before_packaging_sales,
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 37 THEN total_sales END) AS after_packaging_sales
  FROM changes
  GROUP BY calendar_year
)

SELECT 
  calendar_year, 
  after_packaging_sales - before_packaging_sales AS sales_variance, 
  ROUND(100 * 
    (after_packaging_sales - before_packaging_sales) 
    / before_packaging_sales,2) AS variance_percentage
FROM before_after_changes;
Answer:

calendar_year	sales_variance	variance_percentage
2018	104256193	1.63
2019	-20740294	-0.30
2020	-152325394	-2.14
There was a fair bit of percentage differences in all 3 years. However, now when you compare the worst year to their best year in 2018, the sales percentage difference is even more stark at a difference of 3.77% (1.63% + 2.14%).

When comparing the sales performance across all three years, there were noticeable variations in the percentage differences. However, the most significant contrast emerges when comparing the worst-performing year in 2020 to the best-performing year in 2018. In this comparison, the sales percentage difference becomes even more apparent with a significant gap of 3.77% (1.63% + 2.14%).
